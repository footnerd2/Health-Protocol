Intro: [Ruth]

Hello beautiful humans

Welcome to lesson 3.6 - Deep Work, Solitude and Digital Minimalism

Thank you for being here and thank you for making a commitment to take responsibility for your health
In this lesson Ryan and I discuss 
- digital minimalism
- solitude 
- deep work sessions
  and how developing these skills have a positive impact on our overall health.

If you have questions about the lesson or want to contribute resources or a layer 2 conversation, please message us on slack

Let's dig in.
 
 [Ruth] 
 Before I turn it over to Ryan to introduce the topic in depth, let's define what we mean by these terms
 --- digital minimalism
 -  a phrase that is coined by author and computer science professor Cal Newport in his book, Digital minimalism 
 - is a philosophy  based on the understanding that our relationship with our apps, tools, and phones
 - is nuanced and deserves more intention than we give it
 
 ---solitude
 - the quality of being alone, usually because one wants to be 
 
 ---deep work 
 - the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. 
 - a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time
 - tuning in closely to our habits around our digital products and social media and developing an appreciation create the foundation for learning
 to cultivate deep work sessions
 
 This introduces our topic. 
 Ryan is going to take us a bit deeper into this discussion:
 

 
-----technology self defence 
-----intentionality
-----reducing noise 
-----digital minimalism]



Narrative / Notes:
Objective:  
External needs can often dictate how we use our time.
Historically, these needs involved gathering food and water, providing shelter and protection, and the like.
Today, in the western world, such external needs are often provided for us, or at least the effort to satisfy them is much reduced compared to our ancestral history.
This leaves the question:  What do we do with the remaining time that avails itself to us?
Time is a precious resource.  And time is money.  It is therefore no surprise that the market competes fiercely for your time and, crucially, for your attention.  If the market can addict you to their product or service, then they will gladly (if often subconsciously) do so.   
Without intentional awareness of how you are spending your time and attention, one will be drawn into the whirlpool of market forces.  
Ultimately, how you choose to spend your time and attention dictates what you will get from your life. 
This module’s objective is to help you spend your time most wisely.
It will cover deep work, solitude, and the influence of social media.

----Story

----Relate from my own personal experience during the pandemic
How, coming into the pandemic, I was not the conscious driver of my actions.
In solitude, I gradually stripped away the layers of market forces and addictive behaviours.  I built up new habits, which form the basis for my lifestyle as it is today.
Using your time

----You can spend your productive time:  Absorbing/Learning; Consuming; or Producing/Creating.
Absorbing/Learning is addressed in more detail in module 1.4, so I won’t go into depth here on that.
Producing / Creating (Deep Work)

----When I say producing / creating, I mean spending one’s time generating outputs, providing services, creating art, etc.  
This can involve rote tasks, such as clearing an email inbox, or deep and more meaningful tasks, such as painting a picture, solving a math problem, engineering a process, etc.
The process of engaging in creative/productive tasks can be termed deep work, flow state, or any other number of different terms.
Being productive can be very easy for some people, and then for others it can be extraordinarily difficult.
Suffice to say, everyone has 24 hours in a day.
Once you’ve identified a task that needs to be done, or an output whose generation depends on an input of your time, you will want to dedicate time to the productive/creative process.
Let’s assume that you have identified the productive task to engage in, or the output you seek to produce.
First, the ‘Check-in’

----Steven Pressfield speaks of the ‘War of Art’
In it, he describes the ‘resistance force’.  This force is a human universal.  Whenever we identify something which, in our soul, we recognize as meaningful, there is a force which arises that resists our pursuit of that thing.
Even if we can describe exactly how to go about the task, the resistance force will be present.
Once you’ve identified that pursuit, your mind will immediately start to say to yourself things like:  “You’re not good enough to do that.”  “Many others are much better positioned and more knowledgeable to do that than you are.”  “Who do you think you are, trying to solve that problem? You don’t know the first thing about it!”
Crucially, the more significant and important the task (to you, in your soul), the more powerful and daunting the resistance force will be.
It is when the Resistance force rises in you that you are most likely to be diverted from pursuing your task.  Distractions will suddenly be so very tempting. You will be anxious to get up and move, or make food, or check your phone, or scroll instagram, or check your messages.  Organize your inbox first.  Etc.
In other words, you will seek tasks that have less Resistance force, and are by extension less meaningful, and you will be tempted to pursue those instead.
In the end, your life has less meaning, as you never get around to doing the things that mean the most to you. 
(Pressfield has indeed remarked that, if someone could find a way make money by tempting people to yield to the resistance force, then they would be instant billionaires.  It is my view that much of modern media, internet, and smartphones are a direct manifestation of that prediction.)
Pressfield would likely suggest that externalizing or humanizing the Resistance force is useful to separating it from your identity, when you set about to accomplish something. If you identify the resistance force as a component of you, then it is easy to see yourself as a procrastinator, or easily distracted, or aimless, or non-productive. These are not helpful identifiers.
The Resistance force can also be termed neurochemically. Scientist Andrew Huberman has described in his podcast that, when setting out to perform a task which involves deep work, the brain will immediately generate norepinephrine, which promotes anxiety. The amount of norepinephrine generated scales with the magnitude of the task, as assigned by your brain.
Both Pressfield and Dr Huberman would suggest that the Resistance force (or neurochemicals) is temporary.  It can be identified in real time, if one is self-aware.  And, one can train their response to the recognition of this force / these neurochemicals.
Dr Huberman described David Goggins as an example of someone who has achieved great things by recognizing the resistance force when it arises, and training himself to be specifically assertive towards his goal in those moments.
If one experiences a resistance force in response to an idea or as they set out towards a task, the point is:  You are on the right track. Don’t be diverted. That force/neurochemical is the gateway towards deep work. 
I call this moment the “Check in”, because you can’t achieve a deep work state without passing through it.
Once you are “In”

----Once you’ve gotten past the Resistance Force, that wins much of the battle.  What is important thereafter is staying on track.
This is where environment is key (see module 3.5 for more).
If your environment is ripe with distracting influences, then you will lose the deep work state.
This is where planning, meticulousness, and habit formation are critical elements.  It is said that “Amateurs have amateur habits, and professionals have professional habits.”  Indeed, this is a tailor-made guideline for sustaining deep work.
Before even engaging the deep work state:  Eat, so you aren’t over-tempted to get food.  Drink some water (but maybe not too much!).  Bury the cell phone (I’ve heard some say they threw their cell phone onto the roof!).  Turn off email notifications.  Turn off all notifications, for that matter.  Don’t have a load of laundry on the go, which will finish 10minutes after you start your deep work interval.  In general, identify those things which can distract you and then make them much less likely to do so.  Put some barriers between yourself and the distraction, at least for as long as you want to be engaged in deep work.
This goes equally for creative and “non-creative” pursuits.  Don’t think that a song-writer doesn’t have a meticulous, rigorous process for producing their deep work state.  It is just as important that they ‘check in’ to deep work, and then sustain it without distraction, as it is for me when I’m building a spreadsheet financial model.  The processes are analogous, even if the outputs are different.
There will be debate about how long one can sustain a deep work state.  Andrew Huberman describes ‘ultradian rhythm’ cycles, which are a sort of natural human timer for how long a person can maintain a steady state.  These cycles tend to last between 90-120 minutes.  So, don’t be surprised if at two hours you find yourself completely unable to resist those distractions, even with the best planning and isolation.
Urgency and deadlines can push one to sustain a deep work state beyond the ultradian rhythm cycle.  It is my experience that such sustained deep work cycles come at an extreme physiological cost, which accumulates over time.  Without planned recovery and self-awareness, burnout will inevitably follow at some point, and it will extract its due.

---Checking Out:
Not much is said about checking out (I’ve found), but Dr Huberman talks about this somewhat.
Much can be accomplished in a 2hour deep work cycle.  But many truly meaningful tasks require consistent, sustained deep work cycles over weeks, months, or years.
Dopamine is the neurochemical of pursuit.  It is important therefore, to pause once one realizes the completion of a deep work state.  Check in with what that deep work state is meant to achieve, and take a moment to congratulate yourself for putting forth true and earnest effort towards a meaningful goal.
This celebration and identification of meaning will yield fruit when coming back the next day, and the next week, and so on.
The point is to find your meaning in the day-to-day efforts, rather than deferring the ‘reward’ to when the weeks/months-long task is finally done in all its elements.
Other considerations for deep work
Balance:  It is my experience that balance needs to be considered in all facets of life.  Deep work is no exception.  In the Bible, God worked for six days and rested on the seventh.  Don’t expect to allocate 6 deep work sessions in a day (at least not initially, especially if you presently average 0-1 deep work sessions per day!).  In my experience, 2-3 deep work sessions is really getting something done.  And if you are expecting to do any learning sessions in a day, you can take that out of your ‘deep work’ budget.
Perspective:  Finding meaning through deep work is an incredibly complex neurochemical and spiritual conquest.  Even if you have the environment set up perfectly, the mind will find a way to confound you!  The key is:  Show up with good faith.  Keep moving forward.  Modify.  Experiment.  But above all, don’t beat yourself up if your efforts yield less outputs than you expect them to.  Keep the faith, and the universe will conspire to support you in the end.
Solitude
 
----Social media
A comment on social media; this is a tool. It can be used productively, or it can be a distraction if used carelessly. On one hand, crafting a thoughtful Instagram post, or carefully reading and absorbing an informative Twitter thread, requires checking into the deep work state. These activities are useful, if they align with your personal objectives. On the other hand, scrolling mindlessly is easy and

Thank you for taking responsibility for your health and we hope you connect with your learning partner and podmates to discuss what we covered in this lesson

Ciao for now friends

Notes from Ruth
Definitions of solitude
Digital detox → digital minimalism→embracing boredom→satisfying solitude → deep work bouts→ moods of happiness → lay down the tracks that our brains recognize as treasure (original factory setting pleasures we were born with)
Embracing boredom: study where people were put in a room alone with an electrical shocker - they shocked themselves at least once while there (but on the other hand, consider Rat Park - I wonder what would happen if the human was sitting on a rock near a river with an electric shocker rather than in a room closed in)
Morning - just after waking is important for brains as they’re still integrating and we go for the digitals taking in other’s experiences. Brain isn’t happy about that
Multitasking makes the brain worse - reference studies
