Part 1 teacher notes:

- The foot structure
26 bones, 33 joints, 4 layers of muscles, windlass mechanism: rigid lever→ mobile adaptor
- Post Tib Tendon: why it’s so important. Nine insertion points on foot, active throughout the stance phase of gait cycle
- PTTD can cause: dec B hip ABD torque, dec ABD endurance, dec hip extensor endurance
- Strong medial column will not allow collapse and will maintain neutral hip which allows hip ABD
- Plantar fascia valuable elastic spring during running
- Rigid footwear effects
- MPJ works with medial arch during recoil, may be enhancing propulsion (Arch compression is primary)
- Use of rigid orthotics has potential to impair spring function by limiting the max strain that can be developed
- Orthotics treat symptoms, not the cause. Limited research supports use of orthotics for 3-6 months. What else do we brace in the body?
- FDB and FDL decrease torque

- >40 deg dorsiflexion required for running, 45-65 degrees great toe extension. What happens when we don’t have that?
- Surgeries at the foot are “symptoms surgeries” generally. Not correcting the “why” which leads to endless surgeries → more immobility
- Genetics?
- Research shows there is no genetic link other than: hypermobility or joint laxity is hereditary which can lead to greater foot and toe deformities
- Research does show that close generations, i.e. mother and daughter will wear similar styles and share postural tendencies
- Effect of traditional footwear / What does current footwear look like
- Bunions, hallux valgus, hammertoes (claw, mallet toes), plantar fasciitis, metatarsal pain/injury, neuromas, heel spurs, sesamoiditis, etc
- Shape, heel drop, rigidity and cushion
- Natural footwear benefits

- Toe splay = can access windlass mechanism aka rigid lever → mobile adaptor
- Zero heel drop = no stress on met heads, no shortened Achilles, no excess loads placed anywhere
- Flexible = your feet can feel the ground, can adapt to it properly, which will allow muscles to react as well as sensory feedback to the brain
- Foot Myths: High Arch, Low Arch, Flat foot
- All are good, all are normal
- What Isn’t Normal in Feet Today?
- High rigid arch
- Weak collapsed arch
- “Top Down, Bottom Up” approach*
- Increased hip ER → higher medial tibial stress syndromes

- Decreased hip MMT → Higher rate of ITB syndrome in distance runners
- Delayed and shorter duration EMG output → Higher rate of PFPS
- Injuries to the foot and ankle → Lifestyle limitations for up to 6-18 months post injury → Increased risk of developing pain or new injury anywhere else in the body
- Achilles: Tendons need load. needs to accept up to 12x bodyweight: 11x for running, 5.4x walking → bodyweight calf raises are not enough
- ⅔ of the achilles is soleus = power muscle in running * Gait Happens
- Ankle Sprains: 40% of ankle sprain patients will experience recurrence
- In part due to: protective gait, peroneal muscles inhibited and are no longer pronating → Increased joint inversion at toe off
- Gait??? 

- Importance of fascia 30-50% of stress exerted by muscle on tendon may be transmitted to other structures: loose connective tissue, fascia, etc
- If we aren't walking at an optimal step length, we are requiring more work from our muscles and not utilizing the “free energy” that CAN be produced to the fascia/connective tissue.
- Why Toe Spacers aren’t cheating, and why they don’t fit in traditional shoes
- Experiment: remove shoe insert and outline it on top of piece of paper, remove and stand on top of it with and without toe spacers
- When joints are not aligned properly, muscles cannot engage properly. Toe spacers are usually necessary for proper re-ed of intrinsic muscles


Experiments (nano to macro)

- Footwear audit (FFFF), natural footwear daily drivers
- Foot mobility
- Toe splay (fingers, spreaders)
- Barefoot walk
- Barefoot run
- Barefoot hike
