------ Intro: [speaker]

Hello beautiful humans

Welcome to lesson 3.5

Thank you for being here and thank you for making a commitment to take responsibility for your health

In today's lesson we're unpacking the impacts our environment has on our health

If you have questions about the lesson or want to contribute resources or a layer 2 conversation, please message us on slack

Let's dig in.



------ Defining environment

Fundamental health implication when it comes to environment:

Human biology hasn't changed in the past 1000 years but our environment has changed drastically (workplace, food, technology etc)

Our new alien environment no longer aligns with our biology and is creating obstacles to health

Objective: unpack how our environment shapes our behaviours, become architects of our environment so that it promotes health


Environment: The surroundings or conditions in which a person/animal/plant lives within. The circumstances/objects by which one is surrounded

Environment is like an onion, lot's of layers and dimensions that affect us so we're going to do our best to open up the conversation

Agency: we have control over our environment (tradeoffs)



------ Types of environment

Physical environment: clothing, food, home, workplace, climate, transportation

[home environment covered more in ground living lesson]


Social environment: the people we surround ourselves with (family, friends, coworkers)
[Ruth]
we herd animals, wired for connection 
we want to fit in, to bond, to earn respect, approval
essetial for survival, lest we be cast out of tribe to die

"we don't have to ditch our old friends, but don't underestimate the power of finding new ones" - James Clear

Mental environment: the media we're exposed to, positive/negative thoughts

[Ruth]
- Internal Environment: inside our bodies
- the quality of our internal environment is a reflection of our external environments


------ Our environment nudges behaviour

We're constantly influenced by our environment. It's the unconscious driver of the choices we make and the habits we form

Environment is the chief determinant of our behaviours

Self awareness: identifying when our environment is working for or against our behaviour change aspirations

Trying to change behaviours without changing the environment they occurr within can be very difficult. Like swimming upstream

Changing our environment to help nudge the behaviour changes we want to make is a much more efficient system

[Ruth] 
- our environment currently is a result of a lifetime of habits and behaviours so it takes patience 
- "you don't have to be a victim of your environment, you can also be the architect of it" - James Clear



------ Designing our environment

Deliberate (done consciously and intentionally) environment design: creating the environment that nudges healthy behaviours

Don't want to eat junk? Don't have it available

Systems > goals. Designing our environment is creating a system that helps us achieve our goals

James clear: goals are good for planning progress. Systems actually help you MAKE progress

Every 2-3 months when I feel stuck with my daily routine, I make major changes in my environmen and this helps reset my habits

examples: eliminating clutter in home/office, changing phone icons around, changing whiteboard messages

Decision fatigue: deteriorating quality of decisions we make as the number of decisions we make increases. example: end of day snacking

Designing environment: making a 1 time decision that eliminates many other decisions. No couch = no choice to be on ground or couch. only 1 option





------ Subtraction > addition

Less is more

Subtract the sitting furniture and you automatically enhance your movement nutrition without needing to think about it

Remove addictive apps from your phone home screen and you reduce the temptation

Subtract "technology" from your footwear (clothing) and you increase the mobility and load inputs to your feet automatically

[Ruth]
Magic Buttons = junkstyle food, screens, porn etc...are the magic buttons we're wired to choose. We'll override what's good for us
It's important to remember how we're hardwired - 1. seek pleasure 2. avoid pain 3. conserve energy 
Our "magic buttons" of modern living supply those in perpetual and constantly
We're not designed for the prolonged bouts of pleasure, comfort and not using energy = all treasure, no hunt



------ Epigenetics

The study of how our behaviours and environment can cause changes that affect us at the genetic level

Our environment determines our behaviours. Those inputs affect our biology in profound ways over time

Epi means "above"

Inputs that modify gene activity and expression


------- Experiments: 

- Write down 1 thing you can modify within each type of environment to enhance your health
- Reflection: 5 ways your current home environment nudges habitual behaviours 
- Write down 3 things you want to change in your social environment
- Have a discussion with your learning partner about the impact of our environment on health
- For 2 weeks, track how an environment change you made is affecting your behaviours


------ Outro:

We hope you found this lesson helpful and took some notes in your log

Listening to this is proof of work

Thank you for taking responsibility for your health and we hope you connect with your learning partner and podmates to discuss what we covered in this lesson

Ciao for now friends
