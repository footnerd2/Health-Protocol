Esther podcast notes: (https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-prof-g-pod/eros-self-awareness-and-esvWF8-VNMz/#episode)
- How good am I at expressing my needs?
- Dealing with my mistakes, dealing with other peoples mistakes
- Describe a time when I changed my mind
- Whats something you wouldnt want your best friend to know about you?
- self esteem/confidence is the ability to make mistakes and be flawed and still hold ourselves in high regard


------ Self awareness: defined

Before we start: pause this and answer two questions in your log: How do you define self awareness? What do you do to foster it?

[Nick]
- Awareness: state of being conscious of something
- Self: me as an individual

Introspection: the examination or observation of my own mental and emotional processes

How well do I undestand myself? Being ourselves requires that we know ourselves

Acting like someone you aren't all the time is exhausting

Self awareness is the result of self examination. The more self examination, the more self aware we become

Self examination: Observing myself (my actions, my thoughts, my feelings, emotions) nonjudgementally and learning through curiosity

Actively looking to discover my blind spots



------ Taking responsibility starts with awareness

Taking responsibility for our health starts with gaining an awareness of our behaviours & thoughts

The ability to respond productively to a situation requires an objective awareness of what is happening

What we eat, what we do, how we behave around others, our feelings, what we think about

Once we are aware of our behaviours and thoughts, self examination helps us answer the why. Why do we do/act/think what we do?

A problem fully understood is half solved. Once we are aware of a behaviour, why we do it, we can begin to change it

Example:

Awarewness: when I feel sad I eat ice cream. I know it's not good for me but it makes me feel better

Self examination: Why do I feel sad? Because I feel lonely and disconnected, because someone is mad at me, because I don't find my work fulfilling

No judgement, no blame, just curious examination

Solutions: Brainstorm ways to connect with a community (yoga, gym), more quality time with family, find meaningful work

It's easier to just eat ice cream. Self examination is hard, sometimes painful and facilitates action


------- Self examination: practices

Asking myself questions: what upsets me? Who upsets me? What makes me happy? What are my blind spots? what are my triggers? my biases? my vulnerabilities?

Solitude: time alone free of input from other minds (walks, joiurnaling)

Meditation

Journaling

Intimate relationships with others

Asking for honest feedback

Self Audit/debrief after a challenging situation/event

At least 1 hour per day with my own thoughts. Full focus on the present experience. No distractions

When I'm mentally foggy, self examination always creates clarity


------ Non judgemental curiosity

Example: I blew up at someone. Taking time to inquire: why, what upset me, why did I react like that? no shame or guilt, just curiosity

Why did I just spend an hour scrolling instagram? Why did I eat that bag of candy? 

No guilt about ice cream. Viewed as the current best option to a problem. Work: investigate problem deeper to allow for more/better solutions

Being authentically curious about my triggers, addictions and blind spots


------- Welcoming and seeking honest feedback from others

Accepting criticism without trying to defend myself

Recognition of the ego to defend itself instead of learning

Entering challenging conversations and situations to facilitate growth

Exercise: tell me one thing you don't like about me (this is a potent one for those brave enough to offer loving honesty)


------- Learning from triggers

Trigger: an event or situation that provokes a powerful mental, physical or emotional reaction, or a memory

Identifying an incoming reaction, taking a minute to assess before responding

Evaluating circumstances and causes of triggers

Taking responsibility for our triggers instead of blaming others. Avoiding victim mindset

The things I take personally and upset me the most often have a lot of truth to them. They are often unresolved, dormant issues that need attention

The trigger is the prompt for inquiry, not the problem


------- Self regulation

What are my limits?

Developing emotional resilience

Prioritizing time to 


Experiments:
- How do you define self awareness? What are your practices to foster it?
- What is one thing you do that you want to stop? Why do you do it?
- Write down a note every time you get triggered by something
- What 3 people in your life can you trust to give you honest feedback?
- Take the beginning steps to try something you think you're terrible at or that you said "you could never do". Record your experience.
