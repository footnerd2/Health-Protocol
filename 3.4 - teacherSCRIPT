3.4 - Regenerative health


------ Intro: [speaker]

Hello beautiful humans

Welcome to lesson 3.4

Thank you for being here and thank you for making a commitment to take responsibility for your health

Today's lesson is covering the concepts of regenerative health and body literacy

If you have questions about the lesson or want to contribute resources or a layer 2 conversation, please message us on slack

Let's dig in


------ Healing vs. symptom suppression

Healing: the restoration of health, a return to an optimal dynamic equilibrium

Symptom: a physical or mental phenomena that indicates a condition of diease, typically apparent to individuals. An indicator/signal of a problem

A single disease can have many different symptoms

Suppressing the indicator = short term benefit, long term harm (exception: unbearable pain)

Symptoms: primary feedback signal to guide healing



------ Medicine: allopathic symptom treatment

Allopathy: the treatment of symptoms

Allopathic medicine: Intervention based symptom treatment (aka conventional medicine, western medicine)

Non allopathic medicine: alternative medicine, integrative medicine, naturopathic medicine

Greek derivation: "allos" (opposite) and "pathos" (to suffer)

Opposite of suffering. To relieve symptoms

Conflation: treating symptoms ONLY, vs. treating the root cause of the disease which will relieve symptoms in the long term

Ex: Symptom = constipation. Allopathic: laxative. Root cause inquiry: why am I constipated? Eliminating symptom of constipation removes feedback mechanism

Palliative: Relieving pain without addressing the root cause of the problem


------ Regenerative health

Regenerative: processes that restore, renew or revitalize their own sources of energy

Health: conservation of energy

Legacy system thinking (sick care): Intervention oriented, increasing system complexity, palliative

Regenerative system thinking (health): Subtraction oriented, reduce system complexity, root cause, rewilding, integrative


Legacy agriculture: solve 1 problem, create 10 more, creates fragile ecosystems

Regenerative agriculture: Stop causing problems, restore natural energy flows, creates resilient ecosystems


Systems based approach: requires a holistic understanding of individual systems and how those systems interact with their broader context

Mindset: working WITH the body, not ON the body



------ Body literacy

Literacy: the ability to read and write

Body literacy: the ability to interpret signals from the body

Physical signals: pain, sensations, constipation, low energy, soreness, fatigue

Mental signals: brain fog, anxiety, depression, sadness, fear


Curiously seeking signals through experimentation

Logging signals, quantifying and qualifying them



------ Paying attention to signals

Expand self awareness (technology use case example: sleep monitoring)

Being honest with ourselves

Recognizing and interpreting signals. Early signal detection by lowering threshold (whisper before a scream)

Matching signals with behaviours

Noticing changes in the nature and intensity of signals

Using signals as a feedback mechanism

Understanding signals, finding meaning in them


------- Experiments: 

- Explain the concept of regenerative health to someone in 30 seconds
- Log body signals you want to tune into
- Write down all allopthic medicines you use regularly
- Have a discussion with your pod about regenerative vs. allopathic approaches
- Discuss body literacy with your partner


------ Outro:

We hope you found this lesson helpful and took some notes in your log

Listening to this is proof of work

Thank you for taking responsibility for your health and we hope you connect with your learning partner and podmates to discuss what we covered in this lesson

Ciao for now friends
