YOU ROCK

Experiments (nano to macro)

- Ask 3 friends/family members how they define health
- What are 3 areas of your health that you want to take more responsibility?
- Ask your partner how they define health
- Connect with your pod in Slack to discuss your definitions of health
- Write down 5 ways you plan to embody your definition of health

- Movement Experiment: Single leg balance (eyes closed) This is a simple experiment you can start right away: 
  Reclaim the ability to balance on 1 leg for 60 seconds on a hard, flat surface with your eyes closed without making an error 
 (errors = opening eyes, touching your foot down, having to hop or grab onto something).
  Shows you how quickly the brain problem solves and adapts with a bit of practice. 
  The improvements are quick and come from increased efficiency when it comes to integrating signals from the feet 
  with commands to the hip about what muscles to fire and at what intensity so you donâ€™t fall over.
