Hi Malin, :) Nick created a scaffold with topics to cover and I just took some notes down. It's just a draft and I'll look forward to building this lesson 
you so I'll be looking forward to reading your notes. You can rearrange and insert wherever you'd like. I'm super flexible with the flow of all this.
Love, Ruth

Hi Ruth, I added some notes here and there but overall think it looks really good as it is. Love, Malin

------ Intro: [Ruth or Malin]

Hello beautiful humans

Welcome to lesson 1.5

Thank you for being here and thank you for making a commitment to take responsibility for your health

Today's lesson is titled "know thy time" and was largely inspired by a chapter in "the effective executive" by Peter Drucker

If you have questions about the lesson or want to contribute resources or a layer 2 conversation, please message us on slack

Let's dig in.

[Ruth Notes]
What does time have to do with health?
We often neglect tending to our health in favor everything else we do in life. Making time to change our habits for the better gets put off. 
Time is filled in our modern world easily and we are not encouraged to inventory our time or to ask ourselves if the way we use our 
time is serving us. We mostly plough through and hope for the best.

- a tiny bit of background about Peter Drucker and "The Effective Executive" (Malin: haven't yet read this one, so this section might be for you to lead, Ruth)
- it was written in 1967 and is still relevant, maybe even moreso now.
- an executive is anyone administrative or managerial responsibility
- so each of us has the managerial responsibility for caring our health and that makes each of us an executive
- definition of effective - : producing a result that is wanted : having an intended effect

(added Malin)
A thought that could be helpful for many is to think about what we are all rushing for or towards. What is the purpose? What are we trying 
to achieve and for whom - why?
-So if we'd like to use our time for things we value and that makes us be healthy and feel good, we have to first identify what we value 
and what we'd like to be doing with our time

------ Time as our only scarce resource
- in Drucker's book, he describes how we can get some of almost everything we've lost back (health, money, etc) but it's not so with time. 
- time is the thing in life that once it's gone, we don't get it back
- time is the only thing that we all have an equal amount of each day - so spend it wisely
- spending more time on things that improve your health can in the long run actually give you more time (longer life, or longer period of your life healthier)
- so the question becomes, How would you most like to be using your time, since we don't get that back? Reflect on how you want to be using your time. Make a list.


------ Shortcomings of our memory
- it turns out when we're asked to break down our time and report what we did with it, our memory doesn't work very well. 
- in studies where people asked to recall compared with what actually happened, they got it wrong.
- then we need to track what we are actually doing with the time we have

------ Time audit
- the time audit is the record of how we use our time
- it is the most important step in the process of becoming the effective executive our time and ultimately our health --> also important to evaluate 
"brain intensive time" and low brain intensive time - to use your time wiselyf (for instance, if something requires intense concentration and thinking, 
do it when you have fresh energy - and make sure to schedule recovery time afterwards to not exhaust all your brain capacity)
- for a certain period of time, you track and record in real time what you do with all the hours in your day- honestly
- example: I have  a book - one page is "the plan" and the next page "what actually happened"

------ Alignment check
- once we have the time record of exactly how our time is used
- we compare that with how we want to be using our time and also our values 
- the alignment check is when we look at the data in our time record and see how much of the time is spent in or out of alignment with what's important to us.
- examples: use your phone's screen time evaluation and see if it aligns with your values and health goals. schedule alarms for getting up and move if your sitting tracking shows you need it etc



------ System: time block calendar [Malin]

Observation: structure is freedom
Categorise tasks based on importance and time consumption 
Create a structure that creates habits that gives you freedom to manouvre. 
How you spend most of your time will have most impact on your health



------ Schedule what matters [Malin]

- one point task lists
- prioritise among tasks each morning - evaluate in the evening
- keep your values close to heart when you are scheduling your days and prioritising your time



------- Experiments: 
[Malin and Ruth] 
- How much time do you think you spend on social media per week? How much time do you spend sitting? Track and verify for 7 days
- Write down the top 3 things worth your time
- What are your most productive times of the day?
- Create a time block calendar for a week
- Do a 7-day time audit (record each day for a week)
- Evaluate 3 items that spending more time on would actually in the end give you a feeling of having more time (sleeping better, moving more, less screen etc - 
that make you healther, thus needing less time to do for instance brain intensive tasks)


------ Outro:

We hope you found this lesson helpful and took some notes in your log

Listening to this is proof of work

Thank you for taking responsibility for your health and we hope you connect with your learning partner and podmates to discuss what we covered in this lesson

Ciao for now friends
