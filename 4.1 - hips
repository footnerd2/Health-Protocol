Creators: Jen & Katie

Framework:
The impact of western culture and the link to hip and knee OA

Greatest factor is sitting: Prolonged sitting leads to
Weakened and lengthened glutes
Shortened hamstrings
Tightened hip flexors
Inhibited diaphragm
Weakened abdominals
Increased stress on lumbar spine
Significant decrease in load on feet


What else are we doing differently on a daily basis vs cultures that are not as reliant on chairs?

We are driving vs walking
We go to the gym vs daily movement
High load for short duration: high impact cardio after being stationary most of day
Living with inc stress which creates tension

Native tribes do not have high rate of OA like western cultures that are sitting in chairs. Ex: Tarahumara still running into 70s, 80s without knee and hip pain.
Not normal to require joint replacements at 60-70 years old.

What does this all mean for the hips? 
Our hips acclimate to one position: 0-90 degrees. All other postures become very difficult including sleep
This places stress on other joints like knees (quad dominance) and TS- LS
Hips lose their mobility, immobility leads to arthritic changes
Gait pattern changes when we don’t have hip extension

Can we entirely blame the hip flexors? 
Hip flexors are major stabilizing muscle connecting to both hip and lumbar spine, sits in the bowl of the pelvis → organs, diaphragm
Creates tightness in the hips and the lumbar spine
Squatting becomes difficult secondary to (lots of things, but…) tight hips that don’t want to go beyond their typical 90 degrees of flexion, as well as tightness in the lumbar spine.
LS flattens, unable to articulate and creates sheering at SIJ and disuse of pelvic rocking APT → PPT
Hips have difficulty finding extension when hip flexors are shortened, glutes are inhibited
Adductors become major stabilizer → groin pain and holding tension
Hamstrings are shortened, increased lordosis (especially in running)

Decreased hip extension: its effect on gait
Hips do not go beyond neutral → glutes are not being maximized and hip flexors are not being lengthened to max potential → necessary ankle dorsiflexion is not being achieved for “normal” gait mechanics → great toe is not being utilized for toe off if it is not behind us. (which creates new gait patterns and eventually pain somewhere up the chain)
Use it or lose it philosophy → decreased joint ROM → capsular tightness and eventually arthritic changes early
Cannot access midfoot rocker: progress weight push-off through 1-2 met heads to create stable platform → overusing hip flexors (hip flexor strain), stress to knee compartments.
Foot → Hip connection
If the foot is not pushing straight through in gait, effect on hip extension and vice versa if hip cannot get hip extension what happens to the back and the foot and knee…
Exercise to create mindful hip and foot postural awareness:

Response to load: unsupported sitting and standing 
Use it or lose it – we love load and force. Our bodies enjoy responding to force/load, yet we often adopt “supported” positions which don’t require us to utilize our anti-gravity muscles. The more we capitalize on unsupported positions, the more responsive our muscles.
	

Hip Normal ROM and Screening:


Standing Hip Extension10-30 degrees extension (don't cheat with APT)
Lumbar spine should remain neutral
When there is limited hip ROM, generally pelvis or thoracic spine picking up slack.
Poor core stability if inc lumbar lordosis vs hip extension (APT)
Poor core stab → rib flare → poor diaphragm use
Corrective Test: PPT 
2. Squat
Chest forward and upright
Leading with butt, not quad dominant
Core engaged
Corrective: Handheld assisted Squat
3. Thomas Test
Corrective test: Thomas + PPT
4. 90 90 
Find your limitations (spine or hip?)
Around the world 
Corrective: 90-90 daily

Audio lesson notes:
- detailed notes and timestamps from the audio lesson [to be added in future]


Experiments (nano to macro)

- Squat: 1 minute hold?
- Can’t squat yet? Quadruped Rock Backs, Happy Baby, Assisted Squat
- 90 90 on the floor
- Hip CARs

Habit Changes
- Eat 1 meal on the ground daily
- Lie on the floor vs sitting on the couch 
- Sitting Cross Legged to tolerance
